# Chapter 11 of Dave Gray's React Tutorial on YT.
Testing to deploy on Netlify and GitHub Pages

See the YT lesson on installing react-icons Chap 7, I think.
Then moving react-icons from dev dependency to prod dependency in Chap 9.
Then proceed to Chap 23.

Couldn't follow the tutorial exactly, since pushing the Chap 11 repo to GH
launches a pop-up, which even if I choose the default nothing happens.
I have to ctrl-C and then just use 'Publish'.

After that, deploying on Netlify is almost the same as the tutorial. Netlify
dialogs had very slight change from the video. It was a successful deploy.
